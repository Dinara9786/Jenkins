what are servers and why we need them:
1. Stay pwer on all the time()
2. Strong internet connection (in GBps) all teh time
3. A lot of resource liek RAM Disk etc

=====================================================

There should some mechanism to put our codes to our computers and then deploying to servers.

1. Developers will develop the code
2. Runs the unit tests if everything goes well ask the DevOps guy person to buil that code
   and deploy the code on Dev servers
3. Developer verifies that code on Dev server.
