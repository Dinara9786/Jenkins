what are servers and why we need them:
1. Stay pwer on all the time()
2. Strong internet connection (in GBps) all teh time
3. A lot of resource liek RAM Disk etc

=====================================================

There should some mechanism to put our codes to our computers and then deploying to servers.

1. Developers will develop the code
2. Runs the unit tests if everything goes well ask the DevOps guy person to buil that code
   and deploy the code on Dev servers
3. Developer verifies that code on Dev server.
4. Request to DevOps person to deploy it on the integration server.
5. Tester will ask DevOps person to deploy the code to QA server
6. Tester may ask again DevOps person deploy it on the Performance server, Security testing
servers
7. DevOps person deploy applciation on Staging servers (replica of production server) UAT server on which UAT is perfromed.
8. To production server

====================================================================
Issues in the annual Testing/deployment

1. Time consuming
2. If multiple developers are working there can be issues in build and to fix those issues
we may need to look all of the newly added code.
3. No Automation means a lot of manual effort.
